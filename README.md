# 🚘 Vehicle-Registration-Plate-Recognition-using-CNN

This project implements a **Deep learning-based system** for automatic Vehicle **Registration-Plate-Recognition-using-CNN** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The system is designed to detect, segment, and recognize alphanumeric characters from license plates in images or video frames.

## 💡 Features

* 🧠 **CNN-based character recognition**
* 📷 Supports license plate detection and character segmentation
* ⚡ Preprocessing pipeline: grayscale conversion, resizing, thresholding, noise reduction
* 📈 Achieved \[insert your accuracy]% accuracy on test dataset
* 🛠 Easily extendable for real-time applications (e.g., surveillance, toll booths)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow / Keras** (or PyTorch if you used that — update accordingly)
* **OpenCV**
* **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**
